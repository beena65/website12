                      Easy access to finances and insurance facilities play very
                      important role in the success of the farming and food
                      sector. BFIs can work with Kheti, with thousands of our
                      farmers network, to bring your services to them while we
                      support farmers to become more profitable and productive
                      thus assisting in securing your investments.

                    <p>
                      Government institutions need data to build effective
                      policies as well as to bring programs and subsidies to the
                      appropriate farming communities. Kheti bridges this gap by
                      providing farmers success records through its smart farm
                      management tool to the institutions while you can channel
                      your support to the needy and rightful farmers.
